License Plate Detection and Recognition
License Plate Detection and Recognition is a project aimed at automatically detecting and recognizing license plates from images or video streams. This project utilizes computer vision techniques to locate license plates within an image or video frame, followed by optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the alphanumeric characters from the detected plates.

Features
License Plate Detection: Detects and localizes license plates within images or video frames.
License Plate Recognition: Recognizes alphanumeric characters from detected license plates using OCR techniques.
Multi-Platform Support: Can be deployed on various platforms including desktop, web, and embedded systems.
Configurable: Offers options to adjust parameters and settings for better performance and accuracy.
Real-time Processing: Capable of processing video streams in real-time for live license plate detection and recognition.
